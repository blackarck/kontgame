# Snake game - movement implemented in Kontra

## About game 
Kontra.js is a mini JS game engine. Good to implement ideas. This program tries to implement snake game's movement logic. 

## Installation
Just clone this directory and serve it via server, no installation required

## Game Logic
1. Snake is a grid based movement i.e. if you move in slow motion it will move in box, This is evident when you take a turn. The whole first block will move then body will follow. Implmenet a virtual grid of X*X boxes, your snake body should be X*X as well for easy understanding
2. Once game starts , check for direction in which snake needs to move, mark the movement in that direction, ( + for right and up, - for down and left etc. you can choose what is easy to understand)
3. In the direction, move the tail infront of its head,
4. Move position of head to 2, 2 to 3 etc. that way whole body will move back. I implemented this logic using different colors, this way you can see colors cycling back and moving in front. 
5. So grid by grid our snake will move in correct direction
